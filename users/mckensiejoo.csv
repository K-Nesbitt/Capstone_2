100,10,"My Daily Goal —> The things that we go through do not define us. They teach us how to persevere through the most difficult of times. They teach us how to encourage inner strength in the times we need it the most. But mostly, it teaches us how to love.. love deeper, love kinder and love unconditionally to those who mean the most to us. Here is to making our failures and our struggles into our greatest strengths and accomplishments.. not because we simply went through them, but because we went through them and made it to the other side stronger than we ever thought possible. #whatiwanttoteachmybabies #theirmomisstrong"

202,7,"Moving on from something that was once great doesn’t mean it wasn’t great, it means that you accept that it is no longer taking you where you want to go or giving you what you need, and that’s okay. Moving forward is what shows strength because it is the most difficult choice to make. #movingforward #lookingtothefuture"
203,22,"When we’re young, we feel things so deeply and so purely. We grow up and the world is harsh and brutal. People lie and not everything is as sweet and beautiful as it once was. We learn the truth about people and it isn’t always what we thought or what we had hoped. But we move forward. We learn how to mend our broken heart and broken soul. We build ourselves back up into someone who is even stronger than before... we see strength we didn’t even know existed inside of ourselves. And today.. I feel that strength. And it’s amazing. Learning to appreciate the small steps. And the progress. 🖤"

373,10,"Today I woke up thankful for my two beautiful babies who have showed me the meaning of unconditional love, sacrifice, faith, hope and dreams coming true. You have given me the one thing that I’ve always needed.. to be a mommy. Thank you for choosing me. They have given me meaning in my life and shown me how to walk with God and appreciate the blessings that I have been given. Today I celebrate them 💜💛 #Graceontheleft #Kaiontheright #siblings #mybeautifulbabies"
