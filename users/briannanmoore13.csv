I'm officially working with Fashion X Austin as a social media intern with a focus in photography. I get to not only shoot promotional events like today, but I'll be doing fashion photography for their Instagram/website, get to learn & work with professional photographers on editorial shoots AND attend Austin Fashion Week. After being handed lots of ""NOs"" in the last few weeks I'm so happy they said ""YES"" and let me join their stylish team. I'm so excited to see where this goes! Proof that in the midst of confusing disappointments and hard seasons of life God has more planned for you than you realize! #AFW #FashionXAustin @fashionxaustin"

I remember being upset & stressed out because I didn't know if the things I was hoping & praying for would ever come to pass. 16 weeks later after writing down these goals, they have. When you believe & pray with a positive mind, it always works out one way or the other. Also, physically writing your goals down makes a difference. #TBT #YayFrance"

699,83,"I really want to write a long post (yes I know, this is my “short” post) about my 2018 journey but I‘ll leave it at this:

If you are completely lost like I was in Jan. 2018, surrender everything (seriously everything) to God and watch what happens. It will probably get exponentially harder before it gets any better and it may even take an entire year like it did for me... but it works. Do not give up. Keep the faith.

I walked into 2018 with extreme fear of the future. It took an entire year for God to answer my prayers and even though there is still so much uncertainty ahead, I am walking into 2019 without fear because God is faithful and will always see me through.

2019, I’M READY!! P.S. I took this this morning while working on my photography business plan for 2019. @briannamoore is growing big time, I’m manifesting it now."
