Looking back to this picture a year ago when we enjoyed our first valentines together at passion and shared a chicken strip basket (which ended up all over the floor on accident) it's crazy to think you were my girlfriend in this picture. The thoughts and prayers going through my life were all geared towards marrying you at this point and now to see since then we've enjoyed the season of engagement and now are almost 6 months into our marriage blows my mind! Thank you for being so faithful to Jesus and trusting Him so much throughout this past year! Here's to many more :) love you!

And only by the grace of God have we made it a whole year without arguing or raising our voices at each other. ""Oh don't worry you will!"" We'll see is all I have to say to that.. Thanks for being the most incredible wife and always loving me more than yourself.

He has blessed Elisha and I so much throughout this year we are able to take this wonderful step. In January both of us got hired to work at separate banks, by then I already knew I was going to marry Elisha. In the middle of March I asked for her parents blessing. March 30 was the big proposal day you've all seen here! Since then things have been the most organized train wreck of preparing for a wedding. I think that's every wedding though.. We signed the lease on our house Tuesday and I move in this coming Monday! We are beyond ecstatic and so thankful God has been in the center of it all. Thank you all for your prayers and support! If you read this you are crazy for listening to my blabbel.. But I appareciate it :)"

478,46,Happy Birthday to this awesome young woman @lizbaird. Putting these photos together just reminds me how long we have really been friends and it amazes me! You've been nothing but an incredible friend of The Lord and the perfect example of a biblical friendship and sister in Christ. You've held me accountable when nobody else would and you've slapped me in the face when I've been an idiot.. And I mean that literally! I know that friendships like these last a lifetime and I'm soo so beyond happy that you are the maid of honor in mine and @elishaminter wedding! Thank you for being a great Godly woman and always pointing me to Christ in every situation. Happy birthday friend! Looking forward to many many more!!
