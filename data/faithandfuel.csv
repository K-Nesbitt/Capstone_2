🌷Stumbled upon the book of Habakkuk a couple days ago and I have been wrecked ever since. You guys, it’s so good! .
🌷The second verse reads, “Oh Lord, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear?” Then God replies a few verses later with, “Look among the nations and see; wonder and be astounded.” .
🌷We spend so much of our time wondering why God doesn’t see us, and doesn’t hear our prayer. But in reality, we have to stop looking down in defeat, and start looking up at the all of the miracles around us. Be still. Be patient. Be kind. Everything is going to be ok. 🌻"

56,5,"Stumbled upon this picture this morning and it reminded me of the true meaning of Easter. It's not about the presents, it's not about the candy, and it's not about the Easter bunny. It's funny how God has taken these last several months of hard times of my life and is molding me into a better person physically, mentally and spiritually. Heartbreak is one of the hardest emotions a person can face. Some days you feel on top of the world, other days it gets the very best of you. One minute you will be enjoying life and the next minute you realize that no matter where you're at in the world, and no matter how many thousands of miles you are away from home and the new people that are entering your life, a part of you will never let go of the person you once thought would be your forever person. And one day you will wake up like I did today knowing that HE is the only one who can satisfy us, and HE will strengthen us, conquer us, love us and remind us that we are NEVER alone and are ALWAYS good enough no matter how much we don't deserve it, and if we keep FALLING to our knees, HE will continue to RISE up. The debt has been paid and HE is RISEN! Happy Easter to everyone! Stay strong and keep falling to your knees, friends 💪🏻❤️🙌🏻 "" I can do anything through Christ who strengthens me."" ~Philippians 4:13 ""He is RISEN!"" ~Matthew 28:6

136,5,"Slowly but surely I'm learning to be content and love spending time by myself. I know I have a long way to go but every step counts! Tonight I ate dinner outside and explored the bible, which is something I never would have done if I stayed in my own comfort zones of occupying my time around other people. Being alone is an opportunity for allowing myself to get to know and be more comfortable in my own skin. Tonight I am reflecting and enjoying my own company knowing that I am truly never alone when I run to Him."
