I’ve gained so much this year! 🏋🏾‍♀️🧘🏾‍♀️💍 Now is the time to look into 2019 and ask yourself what do I want to accomplish? Where do I want to be?
If reclaiming your health is on that list, I would love to help you. Private message me your goals and let’s create and obtainable plan for you!
How great would it be to set not a New Years resolution BUT a New Years sustainable goal!! 🎉

4 years ago on the Left ⬅️:
Hated wearing our dress because my panty hose cut into my stomach and constantly rolled down.🙅🏾‍♀️
My feet would kill me in heels regardless of height!
I could never find the right size, too tight size 14/16 or too big size 18!
Constantly turning sideways to make it down the aisle!

Today on the Right➡️:
LOVE wearing our new signature dress, it’s a loose size 8 🎉! My panty hose stay up ALL day!
I forget I have my heels on inflight because being 70 lbs lighter makes wearing heels 👠 10x better!
I glide down the aisle with ease and it’s an incredible feeling 🤗! This program has been an absolute chain breaker for me 🙌🏾 .

35,5,"I’ll start with the good news!! 56 lbs ⬇️ since 9/1/17 🎉
1st pic shows that success! I owe that weight loss to the Ketogenic diet. Unfortunately, for me that weight loss came at a price that I’m now trying to recover from. At first, I felt great on Keto and I was super passionate to share it with everyone I talked to. I did a ton of research and I was confident in eating a high fat, moderate protein and low carb diet. I made sure I had plenty of low carb veggies, I switched to monosaturated fats after I got a slightly alarming cholesterol reading. I was determined to make Keto work because finally I felt like I wasn’t addicted to food, I loved the way I looked and I wanted to lose more weight.🤷🏾‍♀️ Fast forward to January of this year my stomach seemed a little flabbier than usual, this was accompanied by another side effect (I’ll spare you that tmi). Long story short my body wasn’t breaking down the amount of fat I was eating anymore! DEVASTATED!
According to the Keto diet app I was eating the correct amount of fat if not less. Needless to say this was the final “side effect” I was going to accept. I got out of ketosis and was stumped on what to do next. I figured I would stay “low carb”, since February I’ve tried to maintain a low carb version of Paleo, eating only 3 times a day and forcing myself not to snack ( often hungry). Two BIG Mistakes I made 1. Not being concerned about my protein intake throughout my weight loss 2. Upping my calories without adding physical activity. I've learned when trying to maintain weight loss and muscle mass those don't fly. Those coupled with MAJOR trigger cheats has left me with a malnourished body and a constantly bloated tummy!
Crazy thing is I haven’t gained a lb but I’ve lost so much lean muscle 😭! My digestion is so out of whack from the yo-yo cheat days it’s just a mess and I recognize the slippery slope I’m on all too well.
One of my besties Sarah is a health coach and has been wanting me to try it for months! So here we are ready to switch my brain completely off of Keto and trade up to a sustainable lifestyle!

According to the CDC: * The prevalence of obesity was 39.8% and affected about 93.3 million of US adults in 2015-2016. * Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer that are some of the leading causes of preventable, premature death. * The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the United States was $147 billion in 2008 US dollars; the medical cost for people who have obesity was $1,429 higher than those of normal weight.

When my health started to reflect my unhealthy lifestyle that’s when I realized it wasn’t the angle, it was something I had to address. Having extremely elevated cholesterol and inflammation in my body at 26 wasn’t something I was proud of. Having my Dr tell me if I didn’t change something I would be put on cholesterol medication, and that it would be a shame because I’m so young was a wake up call.
This is what I mean when I say I reclaimed my health ♥️

My Fiancé loves hiking basically, he loves all things involving physical activity. Me … not so much I felt like I couldn’t match his endurance and I hated sweating on TOP of feeling sluggish. So this first picture on the left is from 3/6/17 it was the last time we went on a hike together (I complained the whole time and wanted no parts of it)

TODAY we went on a hike I PLANNED! He was shocked when we arrived at the park. It was amazinggg I kept up with him effortlessly, felt so light on my feet, and who cared about the sweat I was having a great time! .

I lost a good amount of weight before this program BUT I didn’t gain any enhancements to my well-being. Yes weightloss is a huge catalyst toward optimal health but it is not the end goal. Fueling my body with what it NEEDS, being mindful of my daily choices and sleep have given me so much more than I could have imagined!!

I’m learning SO much that I don’t even question if I’ll be able to maintain after I complete the current plan I’m on.
So cheers to the small wins, cheers to improving well-being and cheers to an awesome community of support! .

76,5,"To be honest I don’t even know my weight in the picture on the left if I wasn’t already over 200 lbs I was close. I do know my weight in the picture on the right 😊, I also know my cholesterol markers, my avg. blood pressure and all those other important health factors our doctors inform us of usually once a year.

How many of you look through old pictures and have no idea where you were in your health?
Taking control of my health and actively participating in every aspect of my life has been amazing! I never imagined living a life this full!
You can gift yourself a priceless gift this Christmas 🎄
Your health!

82,5,"Today was such an awesome day for me! I’ve been attending and giving to CLC Austin since 2016. As a flight attendant I always said my schedule was too unpredictable to really get involved in church. As you all know I’m currently breaking through so many limitations I’ve set for myself in my life, well it's because God has shifted so many things in my life.
So today the announcement came on about the Start Here class and I thought today would be a good day to go see what I can do to get actively involved. Not only did I find some awesome ways to get involved BUT I officially became a member of Christian Life Church here in Austin and I’m SO excited! God’s timing is so incredible, every aspect of my life is improving and growing I couldn’t be happier!🤗
I’m working toward that sweet spot of Optimal Health and feels amazing! .

83,5,"The picture on the left was from a trip we took to Dallas for my Goddaughters birthday, I had such a great day.♥️ BUT I vividly remember being so uncomfortable the entire day. 😣
These jeans were the only jeans I had that didn’t stretch. 👖
The shirt was the only shirt I had lose enough to hide how tight the jeans were. 👚
I remember playing on the floor with my Goddaughter and the jeans digging into my stomach I was so uncomfortable! I obviously needed to go up a size but I refused to. 🙅🏾‍♀️
When I saw this picture I was so unhappy with it, I didn’t have anything to cover my stomach with expect my arm and that didn’t do much to camouflage. So I cropped it chest up before I posted it.💁🏾‍♀️ That was norm, camouflaging, cropping or just avoiding taking pictures sitting down.
NOW 🌟
No more cropping
No more camouflaging
No more discomfort

I feel so free and so comfortable in my clothes and skin! So thankful for my program and my commitment to bettering myself!🤗

85,5,"So many blessings this year and so much to be thankful for! My heart is so full and I’m so grateful for the challenges, the triumphs and the losses because I learned from them. This year I was stretched and twisted but I didn’t break. God lifted me and carried me to the other side.
I shed a lot of baggage 🧳 this past year physically and emotionally. I made room for all the blessings God was trying to give me. I felt like my hair was the last piece of baggage I needed to drop off. So four days after the wedding with my husband 🥰 by my side for emotional support I chopped it off!
I feeeelllll amazing!! I felt relief come over my whole body when she snipped off the pony tail! I turn 28 on December 10th and I get to walk into a new age with a new mindset, new body and a husband! ♥️

Last night at the gym I tried and I was barely able to pick it up! Then I added 20 lbs to symbolize my 70 lb total weight loss. Wow!
The weights above symbolize what I’ve shed! So grateful 😊

I’m at the bus stop and I’m still able to smile even though I’m tired and would have loved a little more sleep.
I’m able to smile because awhile ago I made the choice to change my perspective specifically regarding to when I’m on call. If I come into a situation already feeling defeated and negative that’s exactly how the situation will end.
I changed schedulings image for when they call to something that would remind to check myself and my attitude before I even answered the phone!

They consist of breakfast together and usually our weekly trip to the grocery store! We always add in a treat 😋 today’s treat Kambucha clear mind and a good ol Trader Joe’s cold brew!
What traditions do you have with your partner or family!? 😊
