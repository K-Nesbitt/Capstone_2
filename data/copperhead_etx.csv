4,5,"Jesus Christ never sinned and yet He suffered so that we could be free. Not only was He put to Death for things He had not committed, but He did it gracefully!! He did not retaliate, He did not make threats, but what He did do is something that we as humans most often don’t do. “He entrusted Himself to the One Who judges justly” Christ knew the suffering He was enduring wasn’t His, but He Entrusted Himself! Christ died for our sins in our place. That should have been us up there, He had to suffer for a punishment we deserved; He was and is our Substitutionary atonement. If Jesus Christ while being nailed to a cross, can choose to entrust Himself in God, then today when you feel alone, get a bad grade, have drama with a friend, don’t let that blind you from entrusting your day to God! It says in Acts 2:23 “By God’s Deliberate plan and Foreknowledge” GOD’S DELIBERATE PLAN, everything that happens has been seen by God way before you saw it. Through the pain in suffering in the end He brought Jesus back, so that means if you choose to entrust yourself to Him he can bring you back from anything this world can place before you."

We just need to adjust our focus to the one who can really give us the love we are seeking. YOU ARE LOVED, by your family, by your friends, but most importantly by God. He sent His son to die for you because He loves you so much. You are loved don’t ever think otherwise."

57,60,"Y’all I would just like to take a moment the share what God has been teaching me. For the past month or so God has rocked my world in every Good and Holy way I have needed Him too. He has opened my eyes to the fact that my life and my future as I have planned it or have seen it; is not what He sees for me, but not only that He has given me a peace so much so that I am ok with the unknown. I’m excited for the unknown because I know with my whole heart the Gods got me. He has taught me that the second that I choose to love the people around regardless of how their actions are in that moment, that Love can overcome the worst of moments, He has taught me that in order to reach my true Holiness in Him I have to maintain my Humbleness in my heart. Lastly, over the past few months the Lord gave me two words Anavo Pathos which are Greek for ignite passion. I kept Jumping to conclusions about what God wanted me to do with that, but I finally realized that right here in the right now not tomorrow not next week nor next year God called me to write whether people read or not He told me to write. Y’all don’t let fear of rejection discourage you from God’s plan He has for you. He’s the God of Miracles so don’t stop Him from working miracles in you, because He can and He will no matter what you have done in your past. He can turn your burdens into blessing you need only to Let Him."

90,44,"We are called to be ready for His return!! Not ready meaning sitting and looking at the sky, but READY by sharing the gospel with others so that they too will be able to share in God’s blessings. Sometimes we let the fear of rejection keep us just sitting and staring at the sky, but fear of rejection is an earth given fear not a God given one. Don’t let fear,stress,anxiety, whatever it may be keep you sitting. God had the power to raise from the dead then and he has the power now. We just have to have faith. Lean not on your own understanding because WHEN WE FEEL ABLE ON OUR OWN, WE ARE UNSTABLE... True stability can only be found In Him."

94,57,"In Luke chapter 16, talks about a man who is about to have his job taken away. His initial response was I am not strong enough to dig yet I am too ashamed to beg. If you think about it that is how majority of us respond to our struggles. We know we need help, but we are too worried about burdening another or even Going to God with it. But God calls us to do the opposite in Hebrews 4:16 it says, “Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” He calls us to draw near with confidence!!! Not to pull away with shame but to draw near with no hesitation. God DOES NOT belittle our pain or our suffering, we do, He comforts us in our greatest struggles, if we lean on Him rather than shy away because of shame that we don’t even need to have. #jesuscanhandleit #castallyourcaresonhim"

104,39,"The Bible says to cast all of your cares onto Him. He calls us to RELEASE all of our burdens, fears, and anxieties, to Him. When we Release those things it opens up the space in our hearts for Him to Apply His love in our life in ways we never think are possible. So often we cry out to Him asking for Him to show up in our lives, but are we actually seeking Him or are we seeking a bandaid for that one struggle? Are we seeking instant gratification or are you seeking the one who will eternally gratify?"
