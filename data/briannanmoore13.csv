It breaks my heart that she died in a concentration camp only one month before it was liberated. #AnneFrank #Amsterdam #DiaryOfAnneFrank #AnneFrankHouse"

I'll never forget you laying on my chest while we watch tv together under cozy blankets or making fun of your tongue hanging out of your mouth and all our other memories.

272,83,"I really want to write a long post (yes I know, this is my “short” post) about my 2018 journey but I‘ll leave it at this:

If you are completely lost like I was in Jan. 2018, surrender everything (seriously everything) to God and watch what happens. It will probably get exponentially harder before it gets any better and it may even take an entire year like it did for me... but it works. Do not give up. Keep the faith.

I walked into 2018 with extreme fear of the future. It took an entire year for God to answer my prayers and even though there is still so much uncertainty ahead, I am walking into 2019 without fear because God is faithful and will always see me through.

2019, I’M READY!! P.S. I took this this morning while working on my photography business plan for 2019. @briannamoore is growing big time, I’m manifesting it now."

You were so good to me. You were the first professional camera I purchased for myself 6ish years ago. We’ve traveled the world together, created published work together, and captured countless memories together. People ask if I’m going to sell you now, but I could never. I will forever cherish you and I think you’ll make a fine backup camera. I may be bringing in my new Mark IV soon but don’t worry, I will always hold a special place for you in my heart. 📷

733,5,Today a very special man will be laid to rest. The man who married my parents and later dedicated me to the most amazing church. He has had such an impact on so many lives and the love he had for any person he came in contact with was inspiring. It's so peaceful knowing he's with his everlasting father now. I will always love you papa k. Thank you for everything.

This is Jazilyn. She's 8 or 9 years old and has only been at Ima's Home for about a week or so. She also has siblings at Ima's Home. Every time I looked over and saw her, she had the biggest smile on her face. EJ, one of the boys also staying at Ima's, turned to me and said, ""that's Jazilyn, she's my best friend."" #ImasHomeForChildren #ChildrenOfImas #Philippines #PhiLITppines2k17
