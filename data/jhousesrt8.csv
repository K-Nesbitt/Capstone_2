10,26,"Got the first 8 or so miles of 2019 in the books yesterday and what a grind. This is Bear Peak above Boulder.. With around 2400 ft climbed in 1.6 miles it was every bit as tough, if not tougher than the manitou incline. The ice and snow on top of that made it even more of a challenge/fun. So nice having some WARM days to enjoy in January.

12,5,Not the best way to start a day.
13,5,"Easter Weekend sunrise hike up to Arthur's Rock was the best so far.. Colors, and weather was INCREDIBLE!!
#arthursrock"
14,34,"Back into Glacier Gorge to Black lake.. Theres something about this trail that feeds the soul like no other. Looks very different than it did last fall. The snow melt cascades throughout was a huge bonus to an amazing area. Also its contributing to Alberta falls which is RAGING right now. *The second pic turned out interesting. The part that looks like the open water is actually where the lake is still frozen, the bottom part is the open water mirroring the backdrop.

15,5,The ONLY thing good about it being dark still when I get up.. #coloradosunrise

17,23,"Finally made it to Rocky Mountain National Park for a short trek. Thanks again @avogel57 for everything!
Can't wait to get back up there again."
18,43,"4th time up Greyrock and couldnt of had better weather. Not even a hint of wind and LOTS of water up top made for a few of my favorite pictures so far. If you have time get up there this weekend. Just plan on goin super early. We were third car in the parking lot when we arrived, there were probably 20+ cars parked ON THE ROAD at 10am when we were leaving.

19,5,"In July before I did the Manitou incline I did 162 Floors to see what I was up against.. the incline is 2744 steps. Trying to push myself a bit tonight I did it again, and when I finished, realized i needed to do 172 instead of 162.. üò† Back on for another 10 I went.. haha It sucked but great for mental conditioning.. I got some big mountains to climb next year!"

Thankfull I stumbled across a super easy(not a big reader), comical but interesting book that's changed my whole view on training and why I do it. Realizing a workout should push your mind even harder than your body has given me workouts a week ago, I'd refuse to do.
Time to REALLY get after it.."

35,32,"I mentioned in my last post, ""tune up"" hikes. I've been fortunate enough to hike every weekend except one(had the flu) since mid December.
Its become a good routine to try to go somewhere, ANYWHERE, even if just a couple hours on the weekend. Even if its just me, solo with some coffee. Even if its snowing like hell or single digit temps. I've managed to go.
I've realized that wether its these short 4-5 mile trails that I've done a dozen times before, or 12-15 mile adventures that test some mental and physical strength, they are all experiences and time I really cant put a value on.
I've had friends reach out to me after some of my hiking posts and say its inspired them to go do some exploring themselves. Cant describe how great that made me feel, especially consisidering I hope my posts havnt become obnoxious.. Haha The funny thing is, seeing posts from some of my friends is what motivated me to stop SAYING I wanted to go, to actually goin..
So to conclude my ramblings, if youve ever been interested in trying a little exploring I urge you to do so!
These are from various trails in Lory State Park and Devils Backbone.

Thanks again for the adventure buddy, look forward to the next.

Todays trip puts me at just over 100 miles this year. The memories, the struggles, and the views have been nothing but incredible. Very thankful to live here and enjoy it with some amazing people.

79,39,"A week or so I shared a link to the Larimer County Sheriffs Citizen's Academy. It started Sept 11th and ended tonight. It's a ""class"" where you spend 3 hours a night once a week learning about a new subject each night such as patrol, swat, k9, jail/dispatch ect. Also there is one 8 hour field day where you conduct mock traffic stops, force on force drills, building searches and sweeps and crime scene processing. These are some pics of yours truly from field day. It is an incredible program where I learned a ton and was a great experience. They're enrolling now for the spring academy. Its 30 bucks so its inexpensive but a fair amount of commitment of time(13ish weeks). However I HIGHLY recommend it. Any questions if interested, let me know.
