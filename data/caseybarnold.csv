From being an intern my senior year in high school, to helping lead Takhamasak (the college ministry), to driving back and forth from Abilene every Wednesday and weekends to help with the youth group, to becoming his Assistant Youth Pastor, to moving to Austin to help plant a church and to serving alongside him @christianlifeaustin. These past 14 years have been incredible getting to do life with him and @jacidj. When Xach was seven weeks old, they let an 19 year old babysit him (the first person outside of their family). I have no idea what they were thinking! We became family. Getting to have a front row seat to seeing what marriage was like, to seeing them raise two of the greatest boys, to seeing the highs and lows, to them having an ear to listen and speaking life into me has been a complete joy. This past Sunday, Reid preached his first message @colonialhill as their Senior Pastor. He was made for that. I cannot wait to see all that God does at Colonial Hill. These past 14 years have been the best. I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs to come."
