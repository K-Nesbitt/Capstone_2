65,35,It’s time to finally close a chapter of my life... one that brought me so much pain and unhappiness.. but also gave me 2 incredibly beautiful children. I’m so thankful for my babies that I can never fully regret my marriage. I’m thankful that I didn’t spend my entire life with someone who never fully supported or loved me in the ways I needed.. && even more thankful I found someone who gives me everything I need & more. Divorce papers signed=time to partayyyyyyy🎊🎈🎁🥂🍸🍷 Thank you to everyone who supported me through my darkest times and to those who stayed and weathered the storm with me. I love you all so very much❤️❤️

143,5,"My Daily Goal —> The things that we go through do not define us. They teach us how to persevere through the most difficult of times. They teach us how to encourage inner strength in the times we need it the most. But mostly, it teaches us how to love.. love deeper, love kinder and love unconditionally to those who mean the most to us. Here is to making our failures and our struggles into our greatest strengths and accomplishments.. not because we simply went through them, but because we went through them and made it to the other side stronger than we ever thought possible. #whatiwanttoteachmybabies #theirmomisstrong"

We learn the truth about people and it isn’t always what we thought or what we had hoped. But we move forward. We learn how to mend our broken heart and broken soul. We build ourselves back up into someone who is even stronger than before... we see strength we didn’t even know existed inside of ourselves. And today.. I feel that strength. And it’s amazing. Learning to appreciate the small steps. And the progress. 🖤"

378,5,The idea of letting go of things that once consumed your mind and helped dictate your path in life is difficult to say the least.. letting go of people who no longer bring growth and progress to your life... letting go of the idea that it will get better when you know in your heart that it won’t... letting go of the barriers that are preventing you from finding that once in a lifetime kind of love... here’s to letting go today. 🙏🏻
