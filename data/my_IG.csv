51,100,"As I was walking to a #SXSW show a local photographer stopped and asked if he could take a picture. He explained how he was taking pictures to highlight the gentrification of East Austin. Though I was not affected by this cultural shift, I was happy to be a part of his story. This picture shows the Chalmers Courts (low rent public housing) on the right and the Eastside Station apartments (starting at $1500) on the left. “Two worlds separated by a narrow street” is how the artist describes it.
