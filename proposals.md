## Project Idea 1:
I would like to test if there is a difference in scores for the STAAR exam since the state hired ETS to make the test versus Pearson. The switch happened in 2015 and there was some heavy debate between which company would be best. I can then further this assessment by looking per test/subject level.

My approach to this plan is to collect state scores from May 2012 - May 2019. I will then compare average scores from 2012 - 2015 (Pearson years) and 2016-2019 (ETS) years. I will run a two-tailed hypothesis test to determine if there is a positive or negative change in the mean of the scores. 

I would like to share my results using a flask app so that educators and interested public members can see with statistics whether there has been a difference since the state changed vendors. 

I am currently requesting this information from TEA, since all of their reports are given in a pdf format. If I am unable to collect this data then I will have to consider other options for data (none of which has been found yet).

## Project Idea 2:
I would like to predict the number of likes a picture on instagram will get. I have a friend who runs the social media for her church and is always trying to decide when she should post an announcement/picture to maximize exposure and likes. 

My approach to this plan would be to create a table of values with the number of likes, and timestamp. I may also create a column with hashtags to further research if hashtags improve the number of likes, or specific hashtags.  

I would like to share these results also on a flask app so that she and possibly other social media account holders can view and use the same algorithm to determine what time will maximize their number of likes.

I plan to use Beauitful Soup to scrap the Instagram website of the particular profile. I will not use the API because it limits the access that you have to friends and the number of posts.
