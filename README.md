# Instagram NLP

**Goal**: The goal of this project is to discover the relationship between the caption and the number of likes on a picture from Instagram

**Data Collection**: I collected my data by scraping Instagram profiles and recorded the following information:
          - number of posts
          - number of followers
          - number of likes for pictures only
          - the caption of the photo

**Issues**: Some issues I encountered were getting the number of likes when it was not displayed as 
" Liked by users_friend and 30 others". If the post said "_ likes" then it was a button and I defaulted to say the number of likes was equal to 5. According to Instagram myth, if a frequent user likes your photo, no matter how few others liked it, then the post would still read "Liked by frequent_friend and _ others" and the _ others could be as small as 1. Therefore I assumed there would be a low number of posts that were not liked by a frequent friend of that user. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

I collected data from 17 users (including myself). There was a total of 6806 posts.

The average number of posts was 432.

The lowest number of posts was 87 and the highest was 1386.

The average number of followers was 708. 

![hist2](https://github.com/K-Nesbitt/Instagram_likes_nlp/blob/master/images/number_of_followers.png)

The lowest number of followers was 169 and the highest was 2161 (a local musician).

The average number of likes is 31.

The most number of likes was 402, again from the local musician. The caption read: 

*"Last day in Iceland. Itâ€™s been an amazing 11 days. Got to meet and work with some amazing people, work with an amazing company/brand, and got to play model while being on some epic adventures. I will never forget this trip and Iâ€™m looking forward to the next. Iceland, itâ€™s been REAL, real! Shoutout to @jamesharnoisphoto and @hownottotravellikeabasicbitch for extending their stay with me and for these bad ass and mostly basic shots. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Results
The total number of words (or strings since there are emojis and words with emojis) is 81,125.
Using sklearn's Tdidf text vectorizer I found the most popular names to be:

**_Top 3%_**

beauti, day, friend, get, go, good, got, great, happi, im, know, life, 

like, **lit**, littl, love, new, night, one, see, thank, time, today, work, year

**_Top 5%_**

day, get, love, time, today


**_Only word in top 10% (most used word): LOVE_**



## Reflection
I would like to collect data on more users outside of Austin and Texas. I would also like to collect data on the timestamp so that I could recommend the best time to post a picture and the words to use to maximize the number of likes. 

I realize that the goal of this project can seem superficial but it was really interesting to continue building my webscraping skills, see real world data with something that I use daily, and conduct natural language processing on the information that I found.
