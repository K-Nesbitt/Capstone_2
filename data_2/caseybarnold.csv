211,127,"April 1, 2005 @reidwjohnson became my youth pastor @colonialhill. I was introduced to him as the person that had just spilled lemonade on a projector. 🤦🏼‍♂️ Who knew I would become his right hand guy in ministry. From being an intern my senior year in high school, to helping lead Takhamasak (the college ministry), to driving back and forth from Abilene every Wednesday and weekends to help with the youth group, to becoming his Assistant Youth Pastor, to moving to Austin to help plant a church and to serving alongside him @christianlifeaustin. These past 14 years have been incredible getting to do life with him and @jacidj. When Xach was seven weeks old, they let an 19 year old babysit him (the first person outside of their family). I have no idea what they were thinking! We became family. Getting to have a front row seat to seeing what marriage was like, to seeing them raise two of the greatest boys, to seeing the highs and lows, to them having an ear to listen and speaking life into me has been a complete joy. This past Sunday, Reid preached his first message @colonialhill as their Senior Pastor. He was made for that. I cannot wait to see all that God does at Colonial Hill. These past 14 years have been the best. I can’t wait to see what’s to come."

242,81,"I am in awe of all the God did this weekend @christianlifeaustin. 32 weeks ago a vision and dream was born, to bring the Freedom group curriculum and Freedom Conference to CLC. This weekend the vision and dream became a reality. I can’t thank my host team enough for all the work they put into making this happen. From speaking, ushering, stuffing bags, making food, setting up and tearing down, you amaze me with your heart and passion for everyone else to experience the Freedom that we found 20 weeks ago. I’m so excited that from the 14 that attended the conference down @lifechurchhtx this past December, 118 attended this past weekend at CLC. Freedom and deliverance took place! Thank you prayer team from @lifechurchhtx for spending your weekend with us and pouring into our people when you have your very own Freedom Conference this next weekend. I cannot wait to see the future of freedom groups at CLC! Every single person needs to be a part of a freedom group! Freedom Groups will launch in September! #freedom #freedomgroups #freedomconference #freedomconf19"
