⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As a kid, I had a sense of wanderlust, that there was always something to explore right outside my doorstep. Somewhere along the way I lost some of that adventurous innocence, saddled with life’s typical burdens of external/internal pressure, paying for school, figuring out my future, figuring out who I was, and figuring out my impact on the world. But over the past year and change I’ve slowly been taking me back. One of those ways is by reclaiming that exploring kid inside and everything he unlocks. (Take me exploring with you, send me ideas, and let me know if you want to come along)

Reality is catching up with me
Facing my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me”
“So I still won’t grow up, I’m a grown ass kid”"

27,132,"Today is #InternationalWomensDay, a day in March (which is Women's History Month) set aside to honor women and to celebrate women's achievement, raise awareness against bias, and take action for equality. It follows Black History Month, which should mean that Black women have a whole two-month spotlight where their long lists of efforts and contributions to society are amplified. It should be two months of society reflecting on how new realities can be shaped by those who come from identities that have long been marginalized, because a system led by/created for those communities works for everyone. However, that isn't the case. When it comes to history, the story of women, particularly Black women is largely one of exclusion, silence, absence and bias
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
If you look around, we’re facing a lesson that history has tried to teach us so many times in so many ways. Over and over we’ve been reminded to “listen to Black women.” Over and over again history shows a pattern of white people (including white women) and yes, even men of color co-opting, using and discarding their energy and investment instead of supporting their role as leaders
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Over and over again, I’ve seen examples of the silencing of Black women in many different ways like the """"""armor"""""" (read lack of accountability and privilege) that being white can afford someone’s social platform. As Jenn M. Jackson says, ""I am reminded how so much of what I remember is rooted in the erasure of darker-skinned, poor and working-class, queer, and trans black women who contributed significant work to make this country a freer place.""
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Time after time we forget or willingly push aside the call, and since we don’t learn, history repeats itself. So let’s do some learning. Check out the link in bio to take a walk through a historical timeline, to listen to the voices/quotes of Black women, and to learn from past mistakes, paying attention to the examples of what happens when women speak up and the benefits that are possible when Black women lead
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Note: These are only a few examples, this is not an exhaustive list. I encourage you to do your own research and add your own evidence"

31,182,"This is a post about a journey, but not one of the outdoor adventures that you’ll see me post about from time to time.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In a culture that has historically stigmatized the public discussion of mental health, especially for Black men, this journey is a present investment in my healing and my #BlackFuture. (I’ll probably get a few texts saying I’m being too emotional or sharing too much but I don’t care. This is not weakness. 🤷🏾‍♂️)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I believe that people often act without truly understanding their own intentions, their deeper motivations, and the internal trauma that results in external actions. I’m not perfect, so for me, that lack of understanding has affected the way I live, love, and lead. It shows up in insecurities, overthinking, depression, and stagnation. I don’t list those things as trophies of suffering, but as context, as the pieces that make up my journey just as much as any of the rosier parts that are easier to handle.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So my path to better #MentalHealth and trying #therapy means I first had to acknowledge those deeper roots I had not addressed. I had to understand the impact that people and the world have had on me, so that I can be more intentional with and aware of the impact that I have on the world and people around me. In order to make the world a better place, I have to start at home. #ItsOkNotToBeOk
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Just as with many other areas of growth, it’s not an immediate transformation for me. It’s a process, an exploration of the space outside of my comfort zone. It’s a mindset that has to exist outside of my therapist’s office, that supports my understanding of others and the challenges people face. The more I unpack my baggage, the more capacity I have to hold space and empathy with others as they walk similar roads.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Check the link in my bio to read a little bit more about my learning, as well as some of the role models speaking out, and tools people are creating to support. But I encourage you to figure out what works for you and give it a try. It’s well worth the exploration. There are tons of resources out there, and I'd love to hear what you do in order to build your mental strength as well!"

My dad’s 60th birthday is next week, and for the past couple weeks I’ve been thinking about how we’re connected, about how his legacy continues through me.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I love books and reading, and while it comes from both my parents, there’s a part of my dad that has stuck with me, this idea of learning never ending.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Growing up, we had a wall of bookshelves in our tiny apartment. Books on every subject, books of every size. When people would come over, or would see him reading something, my dad would let them borrow the book, give away the book, or buy another copy for them, sharing that knowledge and building connections through books.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Sharing a book is personal, telling someone that there are ideas you believe might be interesting or helpful or entertaining, sharing learning, sharing life experiences.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’ve seen myself growing into that sharing, that legacy, so I’m giving away a few of my favorite books! These books are a collection of my childhood favorites, tools in my work and personal life, and a celebration of Black women authors.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Books:
-Children Of Blood and Bone (@tadeyemibooks) & Empathy (Roman Krznaric)
-Honey I Love (Eloise Greenfield) & Teaching Community (@bellhooks_)
-The Chronicles Of Narnia (CS Lewis) & Black Faces, White Spaces (Carolyn Finney)

130,201,"Struggle is a part of life, and overcoming struggle a part of growth. That element of challenge is a big reason why I love climbing.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The first time I ever went climbing, a few friends took me to Mazama. Now as a kid, I used to climb EVERYTHING (ask my mom). So I was preeetty confident this would be simple. I mean, I’m an athlete right?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I Thor’d my way through a few routes (“ANOTHER!”), confidence right through the bright blue skies I was climbing under
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Then it hit. The route that wasn’t straightforward, the mental/emotional baggage I hadn’t beat yet, the challenge that wasn’t like ones I had faced before, the tough semester in school or the semesters out of it, the hold/crimp that would force me out of my comfort zone
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
And I sat there.
I sat, strung up stories above the ground, arms pumped up and unable to drag me through, ready to quit. I asked to be let down (multiple times, and my friends didn’t let me, literally and figuratively). So I sat. I sat, then tried, and sat, then tried something different. I sat, and cried (jk), and sat, then asked for advice
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Eventually, I made it to the top of that route (then they let me down). While I made it to the top this time, climbing is a reminder of those times in the middle, the struggle, the learning, the growth
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So for those of you who are facing those sitting moments in life, the middle moments of your climb, I hope these reminders help you find your next hold:
- It’s ok to sit and not have a next move. Sometimes it’s ok to pause and regain energy for what comes next
- It’s ok not to be strong all the time. Just like in climbing when you can’t muscle through everything, strategy can help just as much as strength
- It’s ok to take what looks like a step back in order to move forward. Progress is not only measured at the end, but in the ste it takes to get there
- Trust your support, seek perspective. I get lost in my head, in the frustration of what I’m currently facing or trying to accomplish. In those times, I have to trust the perspective of those who are mentors (more experienced climbers) or the support of family/friends (my harness/belay)."

137,215,"What was your introduction to the outdoors?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This question is often asked in the outdoor recreation and environmental education fields, an effort to build common ground as people share the grounding experiences that inspired their love or connection to nature and the outdoors. Often these founding experiences are an adult introducing people to camping, first time canoeing/climbing, or family trips to national parks as a kid (if you were so lucky).
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Last year, the folks over at @brownenvironmentalist started a campaign to amplify the experiences, contributions and leadership of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in the environment. BE uses the hashtag #BeenOutside to “celebrate the different and many ways that BIPOC have spent time in the outdoors for generations and throughout history, and how bipoc continue to enjoy time outside today.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
As I look back and write my #BlackHistory, and tell the story of my connection to nature, I honor the fact that it was planted in me by my mother’s fertilizer-soiled hands. As I look forward and write my #BlackFuture and my journey as an educator, I honor and realize that growth also has its roots in my grandmother’s #GouldingGardens. An educator, or anyone seeking to create lasting change in a community, has to live and teach with their mindset, the mindset of a gardener. Just as a gardener creates neither the seeds nor the soil that are in their garden, an educator organizes and brings together the resources available in their community. Just as the gardener tends to the environment surrounding the plants and their potential for growth, resilience, and sustainability, an educator also has to have a keen sense of awareness of the different factors that both block and encourage the growth of the young leaders or people they work with (in my case).

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
When the students sat down at the ""white only"" counter of Woolworths they were told they would not be served. The police were called, but the Greensboro Four stayed until the store closed that day. The following day, twelve African Americans sat at the counter, and the protest grew.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The group returned the next day with 25 men and four women and sat at the lunch counter from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. enduring racist vitriol from the white customers. The students sat with their books ignoring the hecklers, according to reports by WFMY News.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The Greensboro Four's act of courage inspired others. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, during the height of the sit-in protests in April 1960.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Their example has me thinking about how to spark change, how it takes courage and actions that go beyond words, how it means chipping away at the status quo, how it involves risk and potential sacrifice. What’s my bold action? How do I show up and stand up for what’s right?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It also has me thinking of the impact we all can have. These four did not become national faces of the movement, they didn’t become leaders who everyone followed. In some cases, they received backlash and had trouble finding jobs locally because of their stand. But their actions these few days were leadership in the sense that they inspired others to move towards change. Your actions, however small they might seem, have the same power. You don’t have to be a charismatic, upfront, national public personality to lead and influence others. Put your hand to work with the skills you have and where you are, and we can change things together. ✊🏾"

250,308,"I don’t lead because I’m perfect.
I lead because I’m not, and because I want my growth to be a collective journey.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In all spaces, there is a desire for leadership. Not in the stereotypical sense of a charismatic person at a podium or someone with a fancy title who tells others what to do, but individuals who help to move a group towards a common goal. Some people don’t believe that they’re leaders or influencers, but…
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Plot twist: If you’re reading this it’s too late. You’re a leader. No take backs.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
But leadership can be corrupted, most often by a scarcity mindset that causes people to think there can only be one, or it only looks a certain way, or that leadership is equal to popularity. It pops up even in spaces where people are trying to build/create community or affect positive change. Even with hashtags like #CommunityOverCompetition.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That desire to be seen as a leader can lead people to build images of themselves that are polished and perfect, an image that’s more Beyonce “I woke up like this” than Drake “Started from the bottom now we here”. It’s missing the “This is growth, I’m not what I used to be, I’ve made mistakes, this takes work.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’ve fallen into that trap too. But know that I have made mistakes in this journey and continue to grow. I’ve failed as a leader by not communicating with teammates and holding a vision in college clubs, by not setting an example of action or a structure with some of the trainings I’ve led. I fall victim to the jealousy/comparison bug just like anyone else. I grew up in a culture that was transphobic/homophobic, and though I am continually learning new traits, it means fighting through old ones that create exclusion. I have allowed my privilege to take up more space than is due, then been quiet as our patriarchal society makes certain parts of us feel like “others”.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀
So no, I’m not perfect. But I share this so that when you see me calling for change, you know where I’m coming from. Not from a desire to appear perfect, but an investment in myself and our community becoming more perfect by acknowledging faults and not being afraid to press forward."

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’d like to share part of an awesome conversation I had last week, and the meaning behind my favorite hat.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
It's a story of connection, the tale of a college dropout, a long line of blessings and the reason why I am intentional about being grateful for how people have invested in me and how I now do my best to pay it forward to others. (You can either read it here or at the link in my bio)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In 2011, I was hitting a wall, in the middle of failing out of school, unsure of where or how to move forward. In the middle of that frustration, trying to figure out what to do next, I checked my school email inbox for only the SECOND time while in school and saw an email for an internship seminar happening on campus that same day. My first internship and opportunity in this outdoor space came from that random thought.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
After that, some parts of life seemed to line up in my favor, and I used to heavily consider myself #lucky. I used to think that life happened to me and was beyond my control, and that it could just as easily be anyone else in my shoes. I shared that in a conversation with one of my mentors, and wondered how I could shape my next steps purposefully while feeling like luck had brought me this far.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
That conversation changed how I viewed my progress, my life (read the blog post for what he said). I stopped chalking up any #success to pure luck, and instead started to count my #blessings. I started to be grateful and acknowledge the blessing of people who had invested in me, started appreciating the passion and hard work I put in, and thanking God for his covering through all the ups and downs.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Besides the mindset of gratitude for the past, appreciation of present moments, the shift to blessings put me in a position to pay it forward.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
You can’t pass forward luck, but when you’re blessed, you have the opportunity to hold the door open for someone else behind you. Your cup of blessings can overflow to bless other people in your life.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
So no, I’m not lucky, I’m #blessed. And now I wear this hat so I don’t forget, and as a reminder to be a blessing to others."

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
From the Gwich’in:
“The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the wildest, intact remaining landscapes in the world; supporting the 200,000 strong porcupine caribou herd and migratory birds from all fifty states and six continents. The Gwich’in Nation depends on the coastal plain, the biological heart of the Refuge, for our way of life. At this moment where this place and our people who depend on it are under attack from the Trump Administration, we must band together and show our solidarity and unwillingness to back down. We will celebrate our homelands and ask for our partners and allies nationwide to join together to do the same; standing with the Gwich’in Nation and knowing we also stand with you in communities across the world. This fight is all of our fights; and your fight is ours.”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Companies have applied for permits to conduct seismic testing for oil in the Refuge, also known as the “Sacred Place Where Life Begins”. The reality of seismic testing is brutal -- their 90,000-lb “thumper trucks” would send shock waves deep into the ground, carving tracks into the tundra and disturbing polar bear dens. And they could start as early as this month.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In 2016, I was blessed to share space and time with the Gwich’in community, other Native Alaskan young leaders, and young leaders from Compton (love you all). Our days in ANWR showed more than the beauty of the land, it emphasized the power of community and reinforced the words of MLK Jr. that “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly (Letter From the Birmingham Jail).” So I stand with my Gwich’in family today, supporting their advocacy by calling, posting, writing letters, whatever it takes.

Sometimes that means focusing more on the stewardship of your vessel, yourself, even while leading, serving, or pouring out to others.
Sometimes that means conserving your energy.
Sometimes that means redrawing the lines of the way you interact with the world around you.
Sometimes that means allowing yourself space to simply BE. Not be a brother, a sister, a lover, a mother, a leader, a coworker, a friend, a brand, or an image of anything that is expected of you, but space to be reintroduced and reconnected to yourself, your wants, your needs, before stepping back into the world.

There’s something about slowing down and centering myself in nature that brings a different level of peace. I love feeling small at the foot of massive mountains in adventures like this (a rare treat for sure), or paying attention to the beauty in the intricate small pieces that are valuable contributors to our environments. From the plants in my grandmother’s garden to these towering cliffs, all these things inspire awe/gratitude to the Creator (or whatever you believe in) and acknowledgment of the beauty of the world around us.

“I’ve traveled before, but haven’t had the opportunity to really get to know the culture of places and the people there. I learned more about the culture of LA and others than what I saw on TV.” Even for an Alaskan Native, Kim learned more about cultures similar to her own while in Arctic Village with #FreshTracksAction
On solidarity: Both #NativeYouth and leaders from Compton faced similar issues (i.e. homelessness and climate change). “It was powerful to see other leaders from Compton connect with our experience in Alaska and be able to say ‘I want to do what I can to protect your home and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.’” On her vision for her community: “I want to see my generation reclaim our connection to our culture. I see that happening through music and through my idea of developing a YouTube/TV show that displays and breaks down Inupiaq values and customs.”

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
In this Internet age, you often meet people or hear their name, or follow them and see this partial picture of who they present to the world, whether intentionally or not. You get to “know” people who you don’t really know.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I also realize that there have been multiple instances where I’ve been quiet about things I live and believe in a way that does myself or the people around me no benefit. I’m not going to be quiet anymore.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
My name is CJ (Courtney Jr.) Goulding.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I work in the overlap of youth leadership development, community organizing, and the outdoors, leading trainings for teens and young adults who are creating change in their communities and connecting those communities to nature. I am also a facilitator of justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion trainings.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I work in the outdoors, but I am not defined by my work, or by any one thing. “I’m like Che Guevara with bling on, I’m complex.” So expect to see glimpses of family, of sports, of my opinions, of things I’m reading, reactions to current events. Do not expect me to post about everything that is going on everywhere every single time. This is still social media.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Also expect that I will make mistakes. I’m human, just like you. I’m focused on growth for myself and the communities I connect with, and in those times where I slip up, let me know. (I actually love getting critiques and feedback)
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I love when people ask me questions. I love conversations, critical thinking, even debates. So talk to me! Comment, disagree, ask anything on your mind.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I love rap and hip hop, and Janelle Monae, Lauryn Hill, Jon Bellion, Justin Timberlake, Ella Fitzgerald, anything with trumpets and pianos, and Beyoncé’s Homecoming is probably one of the best performances ever. I miss the old Kanye.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I love adventure and going to new places. I love sports🏀🏈. I love people!
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I’m really just a goofy, grown ass kid 🤪. I really believe that what everyone else sees as ‘cool’ is just someone who accepts and owns who they are, quirks and all. So please don’t ever feel like I’m unapproachable!"

It's an honor to be counted among this band of game changers and misfits!"

Shout out to friends (Mikey, Abe, Sarah) this past week for helping me clear my mind and get a little closer to the impact I know I can have. I’m not in my zone yet, but the picture is a little clearer and I’m praying for the guidance and discipline to make those steps."

526,46,"And on late nights I'll remember these
Flashbacks and memories
The ""wha gwans"", the hug and squeeze
The 1st grandchild bouncing on your knees
The sacrifices that you made
to satisfy your family's needs
The times I hit rock bottom and could no one in my family please
You were in my corner, with clear reminders you would never leave
And now your breath has left you, no more coughing, no more gasp or wheeze
I sit here hoping that my apple doesn't fall far from your tree
And I'm not alone, you left a giant orchard as your legacy!
So although today we said goodbye to Grandpa, Ozzy, Pops, to Brother G
I am because you were,
Grateful and I will forever be
So rest in peace grandfather,
Now your body's fight can finally ease.
We'll take it on from here,
Until we see you in eternity."

543,242,"If you know me, you know that I LOVE kids. There’s something pure and un(adult)erated about the way they see life, from the highs to the lows, their seemingly incessant energy, joy, and the way they constantly stay in the present. •
A friend of mine recently told me that I “suck up to kids”, which is pretty much true in the sense that when with them, I hop into their shoes and experience life with them and through their eyes in order to connect. At the end of the day, isn’t that we all truly want from others? •
These young ladies welcomed me into their club, their family, at the Latino Outdoors (@latinooutdoors) Campout this fall and I couldn’t have been happier when they asked me to join their picture."
