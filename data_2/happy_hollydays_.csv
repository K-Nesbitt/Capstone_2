I fell in love with the little town, as well as my host family who were so caring and welcoming. I feel so grateful that I was able to experience that month of growth and independence. I truly got to know myself and realized that I am stronger and more capable than I believed. Cuenca will always hold a place in my heart, and I will be back one day."
