356,41,"Today is August 1st, which means in thirty three days I'll be taking by far the biggest step I've ever taken in my entire life. By the grace of God I get to take Elisha's hand in marriage. He has blessed Elisha and I so much throughout this year we are able to take this wonderful step. In January both of us got hired to work at separate banks, by then I already knew I was going to marry Elisha. In the middle of March I asked for her parents blessing. March 30 was the big proposal day you've all seen here! Since then things have been the most organized train wreck of preparing for a wedding. I think that's every wedding though.. We signed the lease on our house Tuesday and I move in this coming Monday! We are beyond ecstatic and so thankful God has been in the center of it all. Thank you all for your prayers and support! If you read this you are crazy for listening to my blabbel.. But I appareciate it :)"

504,33,Happy Valentine's Day to this beautiful bride of mine! Thank you for being the best wife and friend I could ever ask for! Looking back to this picture a year ago when we enjoyed our first valentines together at passion and shared a chicken strip basket (which ended up all over the floor on accident) it's crazy to think you were my girlfriend in this picture. The thoughts and prayers going through my life were all geared towards marrying you at this point and now to see since then we've enjoyed the season of engagement and now are almost 6 months into our marriage blows my mind! Thank you for being so faithful to Jesus and trusting Him so much throughout this past year! Here's to many more :) love you!
505,59,A checkup at the doctor and a nice car ride wore me out today! So now.. Sleep! #judahbeaukelch
506,49,"Happy Birthday to one of my best friends and the best man in my wedding @jessechaney he turned 23 today! I feel like you just walked through my front door yesterday and ""22"" by T swift was blaring in my living room. Or the many times/countries we've shared a hotel room bed or air mattress on a mission trip. Thank you for doing nothing but pour into my heart and help raise me in my walk with Christ. Love you brother! Hope today is awesome!"
507,49,"Today is my beautiful brides birthday:) she turns twenty one today and let me tell you I couldn't be more proud of anybody in the entire world! She has survived a crazy last year of being my girlfriend, finance, and wife and that alone is enough to drive somebody crazy! She planned a beautiful wedding for 5 months of her twentieth year and all along still loved and served me way more than I deserved! Here's to another year of life full of blessings :) I love you forever more than always Elisha :)"

Many said ""beware! The first year is always the hardest!"" And I just wanna say.. You were wrong! We are a team and a dang good one at that. We've got each other's backs and nothing can change that. And only by the grace of God have we made it a whole year without arguing or raising our voices at each other. ""Oh don't worry you will!"" We'll see is all I have to say to that.. Thanks for being the most incredible wife and always loving me more than yourself. Judah and I are going to fight over who gets time with you more ;) Happy anniversary and I love you forever more than always!"
