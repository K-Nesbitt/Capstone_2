It's amazing what planning out your meals for the week can do to your body and sanity 😝 I'm trying to follow the 80/20 rule here, that's 80% of your health is what you eat while 20% is exercise! You can ""work out"" as much as you want but you can't ""out work"" your diet. They go 🤚 Mano a mano 🤚
Now don't think I'm doing this all by myself! The ""Fit b4 the 1st"" accountability group is in full swing and we welcome anyone at anytime who's ready to kick the Holiday slump and kick it into gear to start 2018 with a ""New attitude"" 💁🏻💪🏼 Who needs a ""new attitude"" for 2018?!

This is something I'm extremely passionate about. We all have this terrible habit of apologizing for the weirdest stuff. Next time you're about to apologize for speaking your mind, being human, showing up late, etc...try replacing ""I'm sorry"" with ""Thank you"" — So instead of ""Sorry I'm late."" say ""Thank you for your patience."" Or instead of ""Sorry I'm crazy."" try ""Thank you for loving me."" It makes all the difference. ❤️"

72,8,"I’ve listened to this book maybe 5 times all the way through.
Each time I get new nuggets of wisdom.
Each time gaining more knowledge of the life God is leading me to.
There is no shame in having a personal relationship with God and being open to what he calls you to be and do.
I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling to find their identity in themselves and in all relationships.
Although this book is geared more towards relationships of sex, love and romance, there are definitely take always that are applicable to your everyday life.
As a 27 year old single- single mother,
I find myself almost terrified to step into the dating scene without properly preparing myself for the new generation of “men”. This book and others have helped me to turn to God for guidance and wisdom to know the standards I should hold myself and others to.
Before, I had no standards or boundaries and I suffered for a long time with myself and the decisions I made.
Now, I can say I see things very different, and with God I can only grow stronger in him and in my beliefs of what a real relationship should be like."

It’s tough to talk from behind a mask but it is even more taxing to live behind one. I have struggled with masking myself to win validation, feel important and earn approval ever since I entered sixth grade and believed the lie I was inadequate. I wish it stopped when I got married, became a pastor, had kids or started writing books but the truth is everything in life can become a new mask-wearing occasion. Especially posting on social media. On my best days I am authentically me and not covered in any fig leaves to direct attention away from my insecurities. I am so thankful for Jesus who can give us strength to live mask free and be who He made us to be."

If you have me on Snapchat, then you already know what's been going on over the last week... that's right, it was #INSANEFOCUS #SHAUNWEEK #SWEATBEADS to the max!
I don't own a scale so who knows if I gained or lost any weight at all. What I can tell you is I gained more knowledge about myself this week than I have in just a couple months. Do you know your own limits? Do you know how far you can push yourself? Have you even tried lately? If the answer is NO, then we need to talk. ""Of you can hold up your body, if you can hold up your mind, you will succeed""-Shaun T
But guess what else happened this week? If I can be 100% honest with ya,
Ya girl hid. Yup, there is still that ""old self"" part of me that wants to push through it all at full speed and to make it to the finish line BUT then suddenly that old voice creeps in ""you've made it this far, go ahead and reeessst"". And that's what I did on day 7, I rested, when I wasn't supposed to rest.
Listen, when you start to make progress and change and it's going great, there will be temptation to slow down. To rest when rest is not what's supposed to be happening. Your old self will in fact creep in and try to sabotage progress. 🤦🏻‍♀️😈 Fight through it, be aware of what's happening to you and always dig deep inside yourself to pull through your highest self. 🤜🏻👊🏻💪🏻 Progress is progress. Big or little.
I Got day 7 done THIS MORNING. And it felt so damn good!! Who ready to kick their old habits and self out the door 🚪 for good and lock the door for the last time? 🙋🏻 I'm looking for 3 ladies to get started with our next group

These programs are designed and created for busy mamas and papas, students, employees, WHATEVER and WHOEVER you are, it was made for YOU and your busy schedule. The shortest exercise program is literally 20mins long. Not to mention the nutrition plans that come along with EACH program!
Here is prof that it CAN be done, no matter what!
You don’t have to be a pro, not even someone who works out all the time. You just HAVE to WANT to make a change, then make it happen!
The next round of challenge groups start April 1st. That’s plenty of time to get you plugged into the right program and in the challenge group, doing it all together with a bunch of us who WANT a change and are taking the steps to DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT instead of just watching everyone else do it!
If you’ve been watching my IG stories, and have been telling yourself” ugh, I want to do something” now is the time to do SOMETHING. Join me April 1st, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!

I wouldn't want you to give up on yourself, I want YOU to feel as I feel now, that ""wow, I really have changed, I really DID get this far!"" feeling. I pray everyday and give all the glory to God and the universe for my strength and the will power to follow through, because trust me when I say pizza 🍕 is bae, and so are fries 🍟 and there may be a time or two when I have both at the same time 🙈🤷🏻‍♀️ so yeah, I could use all the strength I can get!!

208,171,"Ok, so all day since I’ve put these two photos side by side, I’ve been trying to come up with some inspiring, powerful, motivating words that would touch whoever saw this post, and blah, blah, all the words!
I have spent every second I could get looking at this before and after. And it’s not so much an “after” but more is an UPDATE.
An update of the work I’ve done, the sweat I’ve dripped, the sleep I gave up, the personal development I’ve done so far...#ALLTHETHINGS
And the truth is, no matter how many words my little stubby thumbs may type, this isn’t going to resonate with anyone who isn’t looking to better themselves. Bottom line.
This “update” isn’t to show off or gain attention. But more to show YOU (the one who NEEDS THIS) that consistency and wanting of a better perception of life, can get you to a place that you didn’t even know existed.
Sorry, I can’t physically show you how my mental state is or how my spirit feels or how much my heart smiles when I see someone working hard to better themselves or how my heart hurts for those who feel they just CANT.
I can only show you my physical change.
I don’t only want to be a fitness coach for you. I want to be your mentor, your life coach, your best friend, the one who can tell you when to get your shot together and when to tell you it’s going to be okay.
But until then. I’ll continue to work on myself and pour into others who absolutely need THIS and Me.
If that is YOU, message me.

It's where you evaluate YOURSELF and your accomplishments or things you would like to accomplish for next year. 👏🏼 The whole process is interesting and so motivating at the same time. I would encourage everyone to do a self evaluation and start setting some new goals and expectations for yourself for the new year.
The majority of us tend to set ""new year resolutions"", but then never truly follow through with them 🤷🏻‍♀️ so why not exam areas that need improvement in your life, categorize them in order of importance and start from the top! A great resource to help you get started is a book called ""Eat that frog"" by Brian Tracy. ""If you want to live a life you've never lived, you must do the things you've never done""- JS"

We are each a spark of the Divine. Worthy as ever. And yet, sometimes we lose sight of our inherent value. That inner voice can become muffled by the narratives we play over and over in our mind. What are the messages that wear us down? In this moment, let’s challenge them. What has caused us to forget that we are deserving? In this moment, let’s remind ourselves that our capacity for growth and strength is incredible. How can we reframe our experiences and begin viewing our lives from a more elevated perspective? Are we ready to stop buying into old thoughts patterns and start trusting more empowering ones? Know this – there is so much more in store for you. The more we begin to believe this, with God’s help, the sooner we will receive what we hope, pray, and strive for.

After todays adventure, this is EXACTLY what I needed to read. I'm so glad I opened my 21 day devotional plan put together by @levilusko on the #Youversion bible app.
WOW. I'm exhausted! If you followed my Snapchat story today then you know I have been meal prepping ALL DAY, literally. I Went shopping this morning for all I needed to meal prep for 4 people, great experience BTW because I shopped for the first time at Sam's Club for actual groceries.
However, the act of meal prepping for 4 people was incredibly challenging being that I did it alone & was on a time crunch (kind of). I needed to meet up to deliver the food too!
For months I've been thinking, dreaming and planning how to meal prep healthy meals for others. This was just a trial run and I'm so glad I did it because now I can strategize and coordinate thing a whole lot better for the future!
I'm grateful for this opportunity to do this but I'm exhausted as heck!! But now I know it isn't impossible! It's a bunch of work that's for sure, but not impossible. 😅"

Darkness turns to light,
And the world is at peace,

Gives me strength when I am weak,

In my daughter's eyes
And when she wraps her hand around my finger,
How it puts a smile in my heart,
Everything becomes a little clearer,
I realize what life is all about,
It's hanging on when your heart is had enough,
It's giving more when you feel like giving up,
I've seen the light,

In my daughter's eyes,
I can see the future,
A reflection of who I am and what will be,
And though she'll grow and someday leave,
Maybe raise a family,
When I'm gone I hope you'll see,
How happy she made me,
For I'll be there,
In my daughter's eyes"

When she feels overwhelmed or is just straight up not having it, she comes to me with her little not so big girl voice and says ""I want sugar!"" Which Translates into ""I need hugs and kisses"". I'm so guilty of being impatient with her and giving tough love, mainly because I see SOOOO much of myself in her and want to push her to do and be better than I was growing up.

This is where I learn about my daughter.
This is what's important to us. To have OUR TIME, wherever we can.
I cherish moments like theses. When I'm forced to be still. Even when my mind is straight focused on the routine of dinner, homework, reading, bathing, and so on and so forth.

349,15,"#whenwepray #devotional
I love sharing the spiritual things I listen to, read and watch.
I struggle on a DAILY BASIS with myself, my thoughts and the flesh, I am not perfect by any means. I’m hard on myself when I KNOW I’ve done wrong in the eyes of God and just as a human being. But there is nothing like getting a good word to bring me back down to earth and remind me that I do not have to be perfect. If there is anything I CAN do, it is to pray. And just as this specific devotion today says, we should be praying beyond our circumstances and life. It’s so very easy for me to be trapped in my own head and worry about my own short comings and mistakes and bad decisions. And it’s also very hard for me to let go and let God, but God has his plan for us all, we just need to open our hearts and pray for each other!
So friends, will you please pray for Me and my family?

Because I get such anxiety about what I look like in clothes and how uncomfortable I feel when I have to keep going up in sizes when it’s been forever since I’ve shopped and I have no idea what size I actually am!
BUT TODAY, I had NONE of that nonsense! I feel so good about myself, I spent more time taking pictures of myself than I did actually trying things on!
I’m full of a new found confidence that I have #gained over the past couple of months, I can’t even explain it. I didn’t go up in a size, I’m went down a size!!! How’s that for a confidence booster! For the first time in a long time, I feel beautiful, sexy, confident, radiant, all the good things I could say about myself, and that’s not because I’m not told these things on a daily, it’s quite the opposite! I have someone who loves me NO MATTER what I look like and he tells me EVERY SINGLE DAY how beautiful I am to him (@theirsonlyjuan ), but It’s been so long since I HAVE PERSONALLY looked at myself in the mirror and told myself all of these things.
Who would t want that?! Don’t just watch me gain my confidence, Join me. Message me to get your spot reserved in my upcoming CONFIDENCE BOOSTING challenge group, starts 5/6! •

This mama was a hot mess!
I remember putting this dress on KNOWING that it was a bit uncomfortable around my midsection, but wearing it anyway because I didn’t have many cute options that fit well.
This version of me was always tired, snacking on sweets, over eating on anything and everything that was put in front of me, no self control, no motivation, suffered with back pain, terrible back acne, irritability, low energy, low self esteem, brain fog, and worst of all, my daughter got the worst version of me at the beginning and end of each day.
As a parent, your kiddos deserve the best version of you. Not the leftovers of whatever energy you have left from your busy day.
————— Since I’ve made big changes to my health, even tho we don’t have perfect days, I know I can give my daughter and others the better version of me now. My energy is up, my focus is better and all that have been listed above are no longer obstacles that make me stumble and fall.
Sure, I’ll enjoy a sweet here and there but I have gained self control. I’m a work in progress, not perfect.
I know there are other mamas just like me.
And if you’re reading this thinking you want a change as well, then shoot me a message to get yourself started on the right path.
Starting Monday, as I hit the RESET button on my workout program, I’m going to be working hard with YOU in mind.

I'm super excited because honestly, if I hadn't reached out- there would still be someone who's just looking 👀 and watching instead of putting their wants and needs to work!
The accountability group is for anyone who's looking to maintain their health and fitness where they are, or for anyone who's just DONE and is ready to doing something about their health and fitness.
A lot of times people want to make changes but don't even know where to begin! That's where I come in, along with the many other strong motivated women who are kicking their fears aside,staying active and being a support system all together.
Whether it's physical or mental, we get you to and through it all!

Have you ever been so nervous, anxious and excited to start something new in your life that almost immediately after you've made the decision to step forward, you end up feeling like you've taken 2 steps back? Yeah, that's what's happening 🙋🏻 right now. I've realized throughout this year of transformation, that yes, I will ultimately sabotage myself, all by my damn self. Over eating, not drinking enough water, not working out for a week, why? Because I've decided to take a step towards my future self and my old self was basically like ""oh no girl, who said you can do that?!"" Well, I SAID I COULD, THAT'S WHO! I put two and two together just last night, as I lay in bed feeling like poo, bloated with foggy brain and made another decision to STOP with the self sabotage. I've come too far to doubt myself and not live out my goals to help others with the struggles of any journey of life. This is my experience. I'm sharing this with you. I'm not perfect. But I will share my imperfections with you because ANYONE can do ANYTHING if you believe you can and realize when you are holding yourself back, and move forward. So what's in the cup?

462,23,"I can't tell you how proud I am of Ally. If there was ever a time where I could truly instill responsibility and skills into Ally, now would be the perfect time. For a while now Ally had been wanting to ""save money"" and do chores. She and I have very engaging conversations believe it or not, and chores happened to be the topic of the night yesterday. She decided to, instead of just to mention her ideas, put them to action! She got out a pen and paper and said ""mommy, what are some chores I can do and you could pay me to do them?"" So, we sat down together and I named off a few that she hasn't done on her own before, but she could definitely learn how to do them with my guidance. I'm very happy to say, she's done a great job so far and I can see that she's enjoying herself as I give her the space to be responsible and I allow her to be accountable for her actions. I mean, money is her motivating factor here(she's up by $3 now) but I've made it clear that not only will the act of getting the chore done get her paid, but the quality and attitude towards the work plays a determining factor as well (and all this being said to her in words she understands of course). We've hit a new level for sure 🙏🏻 It's definitely a big deal for me to be able to see her growth in these small ways. #blessed #winning #parenting #growth"

I swear week one and two I was literally pissed at this step because the ridges hurt my hand and it was too slippery. I just looked for reasons not to WANT to use this step. But it’s grown on me. Even tho I use my yoga mat as cushion, more often then not, now, I find myself pushing the mat aside and letting myself feel the ridges and push myself to grip that slippery step.

483,26,"✨Story time! ✨

I’ve been on this journey for a while now, not only just the past few months but as many of you know, for the past couple of years.
When you have goals you also have to truly think about what kind of problems or discomfort are you willing to go through to reach that goal.
Here are my struggles all in one post.
A couple weekends ago I was so pumped that I was finally finishing a workout program for the 2nd time! I thought the first round was very challenging and decided to do it all over again! And why not?! I am healthy and capable!
This was an hour long intense cardio program. Just this one day, it’s called “Shaun-A-thon”. Now I’ve never run a marathon but I would don’t imagine it felt something like the way I did at the end of this days workout 😬
I was exhausted, wanted to cry and felt defeated and wanted to give up. Yup. That’s how I felt. So I called my main cheerleader to rescue me from myself and made him stay to help motivate me to finish!
It was so tough. But I finished!
Now I say all of that to make it very clear that I chose these struggles. I chose to put myself out there, to look crazy, unflattering, look like I’m struggling, look strong, look good, look bad, ALL THE WAYS!
And yet I also chose to motivate others, inspire, show others just like me that it’s possible! It’s tough but it’s possible to make positive changes and form new habits!
It’s so easy to sit back and watch other do the things and make the change. But that’s what they (we) are doing to better THEIR life. What are YOU going to do to better yours?
Find your tribe that will keep you motivated and who will push you towards excellence!
Need somewhere to start or want an accountability partner? I’ll be here when you’re ready. I GOTCHU MY FRIEND!! #strongwomen #healthmotivation #fitnessinspo #conqueryourmind #transformyourlife #transform20 #supportsystem #progressnotperfection"
484,12,"✨workout where you can and do what you can with the time you have ✨. Usually I workout in my bedroom where both my daughter and I sleep, and usually it's no big deal to have the lights on and to hit play at a normal volume. Today, not so much. I managed to wake up my peacefully sleeping child at 4:30am with my ruckus, so ""to the play room it is!"" And of course being out of my usual space through me off, which delayed my workout. But didn't stop me from getting in a good 10mins of #T25 Dynamic Core! #sweatbeads are now in the playroom today! Get it when you can friends, a little displacement never hurt your progress, it only allows you to adjust and keep going! 💪🏻👊🏻"
485,5,
486,3,I hear you ☝🏼
487,8,"This says it perfectly. I tend to be very hard on myself when it comes to setting examples and pursuing something. The other day a good friend of mine mirrored me after I told them exactly what I am ""afraid"" of when it comes to sharing and teaching/leading. And you know what? My own fears and insecurities were so silly that I was speechless 😶. I don't need to be perfect, I just need to be perfectly imperfect and show other how to do the same. #love #light #gratitude #vibes✨ #hardworkpaysoff"

505,26,"☀️Summer to Swim not Sink☀️ Who's with me!? Here's the thing,
8 weeks ago I STRONGLY DISLIKED who I had let myself become, physically and mentally.
My clothes didn't fit me how I wanted them to and I was straight up tired and irritable ALL THE TIME. Zero motivation, seriously.
Then, I noticed myself feeling sick often, and with my family history of diabetes and other diseases, I started to think 💭 I was becoming ill. That scared the heck out of me! So I decided I HAD to do something and fast! I am too young and have way too many dreams to accomplish to be worrying about becoming sick. Not to mention parenting was definitely becoming was more overwhelming than I was use to and even that in itself was a wake up call!
Look, I know how hard it is to find the time and motivation to even try a new lifestyle, but can I just let you in on a secret of mine? (Whispers) if it's important enough to you, then the time and motivation will come (ends whisper)

I have since learned to manage my time better, even if that means being selfish at 4am to get my workout in and have me time before driving across town to take my daughter to school while plugged into whatever personal development book I've got going on at the moment.
The very small changes I've managed to make have shown up in very big ways and I couldn't be more proud of myself.
Do have a six pack or flat abs? No, but I'm on my way to it!
Do I have to sneak in 10-20min naps every chance I can get? Heck yeah!
See I knew from the beginning this was no picnic, so I ""adjusted my sail"" and am now riding the waves 🌊. I bet there are many others who are at the point where they are DONE with starting over, just like I was. 🙋🏻and still am.
Now, with all this being said, if you're DONE with starting over, I want you to drop a 🙅🏻 or 🙅🏻‍♂️ down below, I want to get you settling some GOALS!
