Great start to the day besides the deer in the pitch dark scaring the shit outta me when I saw the reflection of their eyes from my headlamp.. haha By product of solo sunrise trips..

3,26,"Got the first 8 or so miles of 2019 in the books yesterday and what a grind. This is Bear Peak above Boulder.. With around 2400 ft climbed in 1.6 miles it was every bit as tough, if not tougher than the manitou incline. The ice and snow on top of that made it even more of a challenge/fun. So nice having some WARM days to enjoy in January.

12,39,"A week or so I shared a link to the Larimer County Sheriffs Citizen's Academy. It started Sept 11th and ended tonight. It's a ""class"" where you spend 3 hours a night once a week learning about a new subject each night such as patrol, swat, k9, jail/dispatch ect. Also there is one 8 hour field day where you conduct mock traffic stops, force on force drills, building searches and sweeps and crime scene processing. These are some pics of yours truly from field day. It is an incredible program where I learned a ton and was a great experience. They're enrolling now for the spring academy. Its 30 bucks so its inexpensive but a fair amount of commitment of time(13ish weeks). However I HIGHLY recommend it. Any questions if interested, let me know.

29,36,"Back into Glacier Gorge to Black lake.. Theres something about this trail that feeds the soul like no other. Looks very different than it did last fall. The snow melt cascades throughout was a huge bonus to an amazing area. Also its contributing to Alberta falls which is RAGING right now. *The second pic turned out interesting. The part that looks like the open water is actually where the lake is still frozen, the bottom part is the open water mirroring the backdrop.

Thankfull I stumbled across a super easy(not a big reader), comical but interesting book that's changed my whole view on training and why I do it. Realizing a workout should push your mind even harder than your body has given me workouts a week ago, I'd refuse to do.
Time to REALLY get after it.."

71,32,"I mentioned in my last post, ""tune up"" hikes. I've been fortunate enough to hike every weekend except one(had the flu) since mid December.
Its become a good routine to try to go somewhere, ANYWHERE, even if just a couple hours on the weekend. Even if its just me, solo with some coffee. Even if its snowing like hell or single digit temps. I've managed to go.
I've realized that wether its these short 4-5 mile trails that I've done a dozen times before, or 12-15 mile adventures that test some mental and physical strength, they are all experiences and time I really cant put a value on.
I've had friends reach out to me after some of my hiking posts and say its inspired them to go do some exploring themselves. Cant describe how great that made me feel, especially consisidering I hope my posts havnt become obnoxious.. Haha The funny thing is, seeing posts from some of my friends is what motivated me to stop SAYING I wanted to go, to actually goin..
So to conclude my ramblings, if youve ever been interested in trying a little exploring I urge you to do so!
These are from various trails in Lory State Park and Devils Backbone.

73,20,"Wasn't the fastest, but 250 floors in under a hour without stopping to rest at all is a big milestone for me. I saw a motto on a shirt recently. ""Suffer now, summit later"". Trying to apply that each time I step into the gym so the miles click off easier where and when it counts. Almost a year ago I started to push more mentally than just physically. Still have a LONG ways to go but happy to be making strides, today is milestone is proof of progress."
