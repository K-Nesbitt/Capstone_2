My mother never knew her biological father. Gilbert Sloan is the man who walked into my mothers life when she was a toddler and helped my granny raise her to adulthood. Decades later, he became my Grandpa. I was raised in Dallas, but my parents sent me to Los Angeles like clock work every summer when I was a kid and it always blew me away how aware Grandpa Gil was when it came to the things I was up to in Texas. Whether it was music, a good grade, or something I was up to on Student Council, Grandpa Gil knew about it and in detail.

I’d go back home at the end of each summer and feel his love from 1,200 miles away, he’d call for updates throughout the year, birthdays and holiday calls too, but I always looked forward to those summer catch up sessions with Grandpa Gil. I want to thank my Grandpa for being #ThereToCare, for raising my amazing mom and for always being dialed in on his grandson. #ad 📸: @visualsbymichelle"

107,610,"to 2018: before we part ways — i’d like to show my gratitude for the last twelve months. i’m grateful for the wins, the losses and the learnings yielded from both. i’ve known who i am for a long time but you exposed me to new layers of myself. you challenged me to reflect more, to ask more questions, to take a closer look at my relationships — most importantly, you taught me to see my worth and love myself fully, and to hold others accountable to doing the same. lessons hold no value unless acted upon, so in 2019 i promise these things: i will be bolder than I’ve ever been, i’ll be more vulnerable than i’ve ever been, i’ll say yes more, i’ll only choose those who choose me and i will make sure the people i love know how much value they add to my life. lastly, i will fall in love (with someone who sees my worth as i see it). 2018, i see little to correct and nothing to regret—cheers to me and you. salud!

190,740,"p1 of 3 · moment of truth: when i decided to dive into the world of blogging and instagram back on ‘16, i was terrified of the camera and what people would think of me. had i waited to long to do this? would i be able to gain any traction? would I appear credible? self-doubt is powerful and it influences how we show up in all aspects of our life but especially in front of that lense. that fear has followed me all the way up until now. last week i told myself, “the next time i shoot, i’m just going to refrain from giving a damn about all of those things and create” — these are my favorite photos I’ve taken over the last 2.5 years. get out of your head and allow your magic the space to reveal itself.

219,486,"This #FathersDay, I’ve partnered with @DoveMenCare to celebrate the most important man in my life - My Dad.

My favorite song is ‘My Girl’ by The Temptations. My dad was born in Los Angeles back in 1948 and I guess you could say he never really got with the times when it came to popular music. If it wasn’t recorded between the 50’s & 60’s, he isn’t listening to it. My earliest memories of my dad are the two of us riding around in his Cadillac listening to old Motown classics, him singing them to me and me trying to learn the lyrics written by these legends who were recording before I was even a thought. My parents and I would road trip to LA at lease once a year and Motown was our soundtrack sense my Dad was always in control of the radio.

I highlight my dads love for oldies because I’ve always felt like that’s where he took his cues from. There were lessons and life experiences in those songs that he not only applied to himself but that he used to guide me and my brothers. I think the reason he always references music from that period as “real music” is because it wasn’t just music to him but his rule book and roadmap to life. Now that I’m an adult, those classics take me back to my childhood and I can’t listen to one of those songs without thinking of my Dad, those road trips and those rides in the Cadillac.
Dad, thank you for always being #ThereToCare and Happy Fathers Day. #ad 📸: @visualsbymichelle"
